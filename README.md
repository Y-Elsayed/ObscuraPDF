# ObscuraPDF

**ObscuraPDF** is an open-source tool that converts regular PDF documents into dark mode versions while preserving images, code blocks, highlights, and layout quality.

Most existing dark mode solutions simply invert colors, which often ruins images and diagrams. ObscuraPDF takes a smarter approach — it analyzes the structure of each page and applies dark mode styling selectively and intelligently.

## Key Goals

- Convert PDF pages to a readable dark theme
- Preserve the appearance of images, charts, and embedded graphics
- Maintain proper layout, fonts, and content formatting
- Handle code blocks, highlights, and structured content correctly

## Status

This project is under active development. The goal is to produce a clean, themeable dark-mode converter for PDFs that works well for students, developers, researchers, and anyone who reads PDFs in low light.
